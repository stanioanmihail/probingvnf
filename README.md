NFV Probing Module

What do you need from your internet service provider?

Would it be high speed, configurable services and a lots of options to choose from? 
What can an ISP do to reach the same performance , now when the Internet means mobility and involves different devices: mobile platforms, HDTVs, clients linked in cloud?

What we want is that ISPs increase their service performance and make dynamic offers to clients based on their pattern profiles. 
Our product will make traffic analysis and will generate user profiles. So, based on those profiles, an ISP can configure traffic priorities, billing services, caching methods for optimal content delivery and so on.
Let’s take the example of the last Game of Thrones episode which almost half of the planet will access in the same time. An ISP should predict this behavior and cache this content for future access, while it’s still hot. Maybe also detect for how long to cache it.

Is this viable? Yes, it takes advantage on network virtualization. 
First of all, this product is pure software, it will be virtualized as close to the hardware as possible on commodity machines and quickly replicated.. This means 3 things: it’ll be cost-effective, easy to deploy and highly extensible.
